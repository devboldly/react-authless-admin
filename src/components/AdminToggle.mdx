<h1>AdminToggle</h1>

## Description

The AdminToggle component allows you to enable or disable admin-only components on a static site that lacks user authentication. Uses the [useAdmin hook](/useAdmin).

Using this, components such as an edit content button (that takes you to an admin page elsewhere) can be hidden from all non-admin users.

This is accomplished via a [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) value. This means switching admin on will persist between browser sessions unless the user clears their history.

This component renders as a button, but can be customized however you like using the `component` prop.

## Usage

- You can place the button on a private page that only admins have access to.
- You can also use it as a logout button inside the [AdminOnly](/AdminOnly) component.

    </div>
  </AdminOnly>
