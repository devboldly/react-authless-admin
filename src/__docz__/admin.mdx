# Admin Page

This route (`/admin`) would normally take you to an admin page. But this is just a documentation site, so it doesn't have one. 🙈

When Netlify CMS is installed, the page at this route will first authenticate the user, then take them to this hash route:

<p><code>{`#${(typeof document !== 'undefined' && (document.URL.split('#').length > 1) ? document.URL.split('#')[1] : '')}`}</code></p>
